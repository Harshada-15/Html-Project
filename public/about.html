<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Harshada - a passionate <b>Web Developer</b> who loves crafting seamless digital experiences. With
  expertise in front-end development, I bring designs to life through clean, responsive, and user-freindly code.</p>

<p>I hold an MSc in Computational Mathematics, which sharpens my analytical thinking and problem solving skills -
  essential for tackling the challenges of web development.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring the latest design trends. I also enjoy channeling my creativity through
  art, including crafting, resin products, and rangoli designs.</p>

<p>This site is a reflection of my work, passion, and continuous learning. If you're looking for someone to build your
  next digital project or collaborate on an idea, let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
